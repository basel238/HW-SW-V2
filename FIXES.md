# FIXES — what changed in this version and why

Every entry was found either by an external code review or by running the code
on the target VM. Each states the defect, the mechanism, and the evidence.

---

## Measurement-validity fixes

### M1 — `compare.sh` compared unequal work  [CRITICAL]

`tools/compare.sh` divided raw `total_sec` medians while each variant had been
**independently calibrated** to hit `TARGET_SEC`. Baseline raytrace ran 16
frames per process; optimized ran 32. The script contained *zero* references to
`loops.txt`.

```
reported : 4.126748 / 3.084778           = 1.3378x  (25.25%)
correct  : (4.126748/16) / (3.084778/32) = 2.6756x  (62.62%)
```

**Fix:** `load()` now divides by `loops.txt` and reports per-unit figures. If
`loops.txt` is missing the comparison **refuses to report a speedup** rather
than silently comparing unequal work. Raw medians are still shown, explicitly
labelled *NOT comparable directly*.

Also now separates **time reduction** (62.62%) from **throughput gain**
(167.56%) — different metrics, easily conflated — and prints margin-to-bar in
units of measured noise.

### M2 — `perf record` captured zero samples, silently

On the target VM (Xeon E5-2630 v3 guest, KVM, partial PMU), `perf record -F 999`
captured **0 samples** while exiting 0. Every downstream artifact was empty:

| artifact | expected | actual |
|---|---|---|
| `baseline.data` | MBs | 24 KB (headers only) |
| `baseline_script.txt` | MBs | 0 bytes |
| `report_baseline.txt` | thousands of lines | 85 bytes |
| `*.folded`, `*.svg` | present | never created |

The cache-miss pass, which used `-c 10000` (fixed **period**), worked fine and
produced 23 KB of real symbols. Frequency-based sampling depends on a timer the
emulated PMU does not drive reliably.

**Fix:** `PERF_RECORD_MODE=period` is now the default, with `SAMPLE_PERIOD` and
`PERF_RECORD_EVENT` exposed. Confirmed: `-c 2000000` → 2058 samples, 0 lost.

### M3 — sample count misparsed as 3 instead of 3000

`perf report` prints `# Samples: 3K`. The regex `[0-9]+` captured the `3` and
dropped the `K`, so a healthy run logged "3 samples".

**Fix:** suffix-aware parsing (K/M/G), anchored on `^# Samples:` so it cannot
match the `# Total Lost Samples:` line that precedes it.

### M4 — no minimum-sample gate, and no silent substitution

**Fix:** profiles below `MIN_SAMPLES` (default 200) fail **loudly** and name the
knob to change. There is deliberately **no automatic fallback to another event**:
a flame graph built from a different event than requested is worse than no flame
graph, because nothing in the output records the substitution.

### M5 — `CALLGRAPH=fp` truncated every stack

CPython is compiled `-fomit-frame-pointer`, so the frame-pointer walker gets one
or two links and stops. Measured on the target VM:

| unwind | avg stack depth |
|---|---|
| `fp` | **2.5** |
| `dwarf` | **71.2** |

93% of `fp` stacks were 2–3 frames with `python3-dbg` as the only root. Leaf
percentages remained valid (they need only the innermost frame), but the
*hierarchy* was fiction — a flat profile drawn as a flame graph.

**Fix:** `CALLGRAPH=dwarf` is the default, with the reason documented inline.
`make_reports` now measures average stack depth and warns below 5.
`DWARF_STACK_BYTES` reduced 16384 → 8192: `perf script` costs ~0.6 s/sample at
16 KB (unwinding is deferred to post-processing), and 8 KB is still far deeper
than CPython's C stack requires.

## Correctness fixes

### C1 — rounded radius-squared changed rendering

`variants/bm_raytrace_opt.py` stored `0.16`, but the baseline computes `0.4*0.4`
which is `0.16000000000000003`. The literal shrinks the sphere by ~3e-17.

Tangent ray, origin `(1.0,-0.4,-3.6)` direction `(0,0,1)`:

```
baseline  : HIT  t = 0.09999999705489952
optimized : MISS disc = -1.9e-17      <- silently wrong
with r*r  : HIT  t = 0.09999999705489952   (bit-identical)
```

**Fix:** all four spheres compute `r2` as `r*r`. Verified bit-identical.

### C2 — plane boundary predicate differed

Baseline: `if abs(direction.y) < 1e-6: return None` — accepts `|dy| == 1e-6`.
Optimized: `if dy < -1e-6 or dy > 1e-6` — **excludes** it.

**Fix:** `if not (-1e-6 <= dy <= 1e-6)`, mirroring the baseline exactly.

### C3 — `STRICT_FP` documented but dead

The docstring advertised `STRICT_FP=1`; the code derived `STRICT_FP` from
`FAST_FP` and never read it from the environment. Introduced by a later patch
that changed the code and left the docstring stale.

**Fix:** documentation corrected. Exact division is the default; `FAST_FP=1`
opts into the ~1-ULP reciprocal form and **deliberately fails the gate** — kept
as a demonstration.

### C4 — verify gates tested the wrong problem size

raytrace verified only 32×32 while rendering 100×100. nbody verified 1000 steps
while simulating 20000. A defect at the measured size could pass.

**Fix — raytrace:** now checks 32×32, **100×100 (measured)**, and 37×23 (odd
dimensions), plus five geometric edge cases (tangent, near-parallel,
straight-down, through-centre, miss). The optimized variant must agree on
hit/miss **and** on bit-exact `t` — a `t` difference means the quadratic solve
changed, not just the shading.

**Fix — nbody:** now runs the **measured 20000 steps**, compares the **full
state** (all 30 positions and velocities) rather than the energy scalar alone —
different configurations can share an energy value — and adds **momentum
conservation** as an independent invariant.

Measured results:

```
raytrace  bit-identical at all three sizes; all 5 edge cases AGREE
nbody     state max_rel = 2.391e-13   |total momentum| = 2.051e-15
          energy rel_diff vs baseline = 9.521e-15
```

## Infrastructure fixes

### I1 — `DISABLE_GC=0` aborted the run

`[[ "$DISABLE_GC" == "1" ]] && WL+=(--no-gc)` returns 1 when false. Under
`set -e` that killed the pipeline, so the documented option was fatal.

**Fix:** explicit `if`/`fi` plus `return 0`.

### I2 — `TARGET_SEC` was inert

Documented in `config/bench.env`, hardcoded to `3.0` in the Python calibrators.

**Fix:** read via `os.environ.get("TARGET_SEC", "3.0")` and exported by
`py_env()`. Verified: `TARGET_SEC=0.3` → 64 loops, default → 1024.

### I3 — `--time-only` still required perf

Contradicted its own purpose.

**Fix:** perf preconditions and the PMU probe run only when a perf-using phase
is enabled.

### I4 — `latest_*` symlinks were absolute

They pointed at `/root/HW-SW-FULL/...` and broke the moment results were copied
off the VM.

**Fix:** relative symlink targets.

### I5 — report generator could destroy authored work

`run_all.sh` regenerated `report_<bench>.txt`, overwriting sections the student
had filled in.

**Fix:** if no `[TODO]` markers remain the file is treated as authored and the
generator writes `report_<bench>.generated.txt` instead.

### I6 — tool errors leaked into reports, warnings were truncated

`grab()` pasted error text into the report body, and pyperf statistics were cut
at 25 lines — dropping the instability warning that appears below.

**Fix:** error-only artifacts produce a clear `[DATA UNAVAILABLE]` note;
pyperf warnings are extracted and preserved.

### I7 — `PIN_CPU` could be invalid

`PIN_CPU=1` on a single-vCPU guest makes every `taskset` call fail.

**Fix:** `build_pin()` clamps to an existing CPU and warns. Default is now 0 for
the target VM.

### I8 — `doctor.sh` could not detect either sampling failure

It inferred PMU health from `perf stat` alone, so a host that counted perfectly
but could not sample passed preflight and produced empty flame graphs.

**Fix:** two new probes — a **sampling** probe (records and counts real samples,
hard-fails at zero) and an **unwind-depth** probe (warns below depth 5). Plus an
explicit warning if `CALLGRAPH=fp` is set.

### I9 — `bash >= 4` falsely required

`doctor.sh` demanded bash 4 "for associative arrays". None are used.

**Fix:** requirement corrected to 3.2.

### I10 — empty-array expansion under `set -u`

`"${EMPTY[@]}"` raises *unbound variable* in bash 3.2. The affected arrays
(`PIN` with no taskset, `ev` with no supported events) are empty in exactly the
**normal no-PMU case** the code exists to handle.

**Fix:** all 19 expansions guarded as `${ARR[@]+"${ARR[@]}"}`.

## Documentation corrections

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| "velocity-Verlet-style" integration | **symplectic Euler (kick-then-drift)** |
| raytrace complexity `O(... × 2^depth)` | **linear in depth** — one reflection ray per hit |
| "removes all allocation and dispatch" | removes **container objects, method dispatch, subscripts**; Python floats remain boxed heap objects |
| "flatten to parallel arrays" | Python **lists of boxed floats** — no SIMD, no unboxing |
| flame-graph causal chains asserted | labelled as **inferred from leaf shares and call counts**, since hierarchy was unusable until M5 |
| py-spy presented as peer of perf | **optional cross-check only**, `ENABLE_PYSPY=0` by default |

## Still outstanding

1. **Upstream workload question.** `bench/bm_*.py` are independently written
   stand-ins, not the upstream pyperformance kernels. `upstream/` and
   `bench/bm_nbody_upstream.py` begin the port. The measured ablation on the
   real upstream nbody kernel gives only **~3.5%** time reduction (below the 7%
   bar), because upstream already destructures coordinates at the loop head —
   so part of the gain measured against the custom baseline was removing work
   the custom baseline itself introduced. raytrace has not yet been ported.

2. **Report sections 5–6** (hardware proposal, conclusions) remain `[TODO]`.

3. **Shadow rays are unbounded by light distance** in both raytracers — an
   object beyond the light can occlude it. Shared by baseline and optimized, so
   it does not affect the comparison, but it is a model limitation.

# Round 2 — remaining review items

### R1 — counters were not normalized per unit of work  [same class as M1]

`counters.txt` compared raw `instructions` / `cycles` totals across runs that
may have different loop counts. The review had to hand-normalize its §4 table.

**Fix:** a per-work table divided by `loops.txt`, refusing to print if the loop
counts are unknown. Verified against the saved data — reproduces the review's
figures exactly (`instructions −59.50 %`, `cycles −61.93 %`).

Also added: a **multiplexing confidence column**. Events counted for <40 % of
the period are flagged `<- VERY LOW` with an explicit warning not to build a
causal argument on them. perf has already scaled these values, so they are
**not** scaled again.

### R2 — topdown output with negative percentages was interpreted

Observed: `bad speculation -73.0%`, which is arithmetically impossible.

**Fix:** topdown output containing negative percentages is **rejected** with an
explicit note, rather than being handed to the reader as a bottleneck story.

### R3 — README quoted numbers from a different machine

`~60 %` / `~17 %` came from development runs on macOS, not from any artifact in
`results/`.

**Fix:** README now states one identified result set (the VM runs) with exact
figures, separates time reduction from throughput gain, reports per-work
counters, and carries the upstream-port caveat (real upstream nbody: ~3.5 %).

### R4 — cProfile call counts were not normalized

cProfile runs `loops/10`, so its totals are not comparable across variants.

**Fix:** loop count recorded to `cprofile_<variant>_loops.txt` and prepended as
a header to the profile itself, with the division instruction and a reminder
that cProfile timing is inflated 2–5×.

### R5 — the numpy "Measured: slower" claim had no retained evidence

**Fix:** restated as reasoning rather than measurement, and explicitly notes
that no benchmark for it is retained in the repository.

### R6 — unpinned dependencies and a moving FlameGraph checkout

**Fix:** `pyperformance==1.14.0` pinned (the version that produced `results/`),
`pip freeze` written to `requirements.lock.txt`, FlameGraph cloned in full with
its commit recorded and pinnable via `FLAMEGRAPH_COMMIT`.

### R7 — manifest recorded requested, not effective, settings

`PIN_CPU=1` was recorded on a 1-vCPU host where `build_pin()` clamps to 0.

**Fix:** manifest records `requested=` and `effective=`, plus the sampling mode,
period, event, and unwind settings actually in force.

### R8 — sequential A/B could not separate the effect from host drift

**Fix:** new `tools/ab_timing.sh` runs the two variants **interleaved**
(A/B/A/B, optionally shuffled), forces an identical loop count on both arms,
and reports a **bootstrap 95 % confidence interval** over 20 000 resamples plus
a paired within-round analysis.

The decision rule is stricter than before: the **entire CI** must clear 7 %, not
just the point estimate. A point estimate above the bar with a CI straddling it
is reported as `INCONCLUSIVE`.

Validated live:

```
baseline   n=5  median/unit 0.048147  rel sd 0.63%
optimized  n=5  median/unit 0.039885  rel sd 0.62%
SPEEDUP 1.2071x   TIME REDUCTION 17.16%
95% CI (bootstrap) [16.19%, 17.95%]      VERDICT: PASS
paired within-round: mean 17.04% (sd 0.79), all rounds agree in sign
```

---

## Still outstanding after round 2

1. **Upstream raytrace port** — not done. This is the item that decides whether
   two benchmarks clear the bar, since upstream nbody manages only ~3.5 %.
2. **Report sections 5–6** — hardware proposal and conclusions.
3. **Ablations for the custom raytrace variant** — the nbody port has
   `--mode ablate`; the raytrace optimizations have not been separated, so the
   62.62 % cannot yet be attributed to individual edits.
4. **Shadow rays unbounded by light distance** in both raytracers — shared by
   baseline and optimized, so the comparison is unaffected.

# Round 3 — measuring the REAL pyperformance benchmarks

## The problem this closes

Every headline number produced before this round came from `bench/bm_*.py` —
**independently written stand-ins**, not the approved benchmarks. Phase 6 ran
the genuine `pyperformance` harness, but only on the baseline, so it never
entered the before/after comparison. The external review identified workload
substitution as the single largest compliance risk, and it was correct.

## What was added

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `upstream/bm_raytrace_upstream.py` | the REAL kernel, verbatim |
| `upstream/bm_nbody_upstream.py` | the REAL kernel, verbatim |
| `upstream/PROVENANCE.txt` | package version + sha256 per file |
| `bench/bm_raytrace_upstream.py` | baseline wrapper (CLI only) |
| `bench/bm_nbody_upstream.py` | baseline wrapper (CLI only) |
| `variants/bm_raytrace_upstream_opt.py` | optimization slot — **passthrough** |
| `variants/bm_nbody_upstream_opt.py` | optimization slot, with `--mode ablate` |
| `setup/05_get_upstream.sh` | extracts kernels from the pinned package |

The wrappers import the upstream files **unmodified** via `importlib` and add
only the `raw/calibrate/verify` CLI. Nothing in the measured kernel is ours.

A minimal `pyperf` stub is injected so the upstream files import without the
venv — `pyperf.perf_counter` *is* `time.perf_counter`, so this changes no
timing semantics and keeps the upstream source byte-identical.

## The switch

`USE_UPSTREAM=1` (the new default) points `script_*.sh`, `ab_timing.sh` and
`doctor.sh` at the upstream wrappers. `USE_UPSTREAM=0` restores the stand-ins
for comparison. `doctor.sh` now prints which workload is selected and hard-fails
if the upstream kernels are missing.

## Why the upstream nbody result differs so much

Upstream's inner loop already destructures coordinates in the `for` target:

```python
for (([x1, y1, z1], v1, m1), ([x2, y2, z2], v2, m2)) in pairs:
```

Coordinates are already locals and masses already bound. The custom baseline had
added `bodies[i]` / `p1[0]` subscripting that upstream never had — so the
flatten/hoist optimization was largely removing work **the custom baseline
itself introduced**. Measured ablation on the genuine kernel:

```
upstream (control)   1.0000x    0.00%
sqrt  (pow->sqrt)    1.0360x    3.47%
hoist (subscripts)   0.9886x   -1.15%   <- SLOWER
full                 1.0247x    2.47%
```

An index-based rewrite was also tried and came out **7% slower**: building the
index lists per call costs more than it saves.

## Upstream raytrace: passthrough for now, and why that is correct

`variants/bm_raytrace_upstream_opt.py` currently applies **no optimizations**.
A comparison today must report ~1.00x — a measurable difference would indicate
harness bias, not speed. The file documents seven specific optimization
opportunities found by reading the upstream source (`[H1]`–`[H7]`), the largest
being:

- `isPoint()` / `mustBeVector()` called on essentially every arithmetic
  operation — Python-level calls that return a constant and compute nothing
- a fresh list plus 8 tuples allocated per ray in `rayColour()`
- `try/finally` around every ray purely to track recursion depth

Upstream carries **more** interpreter overhead than the stand-in (7 spheres,
two lights, a Point/Vector type split), so the ceiling should be higher, not
lower.

## Verified

All eight workloads pass `--mode verify`. The upstream raytrace passthrough is
bit-identical to its baseline at 24×24, **100×100 (measured)** and 37×23.

## Still outstanding

1. **Optimizations on the upstream kernels** — deliberately deferred.
2. **Report sections 5–6** — hardware proposal and conclusions.
3. `perf_event_paranoid` resets to a blocking value on reboot; persist it via
   `/etc/sysctl.d/99-perf.conf` or kernel frames stay unresolved.

# Round 4 — the workload is now self-proving

## The defect that prompted this

Round 3 claimed the pipeline measured the real benchmarks. A tamper test proved
otherwise: editing upstream's sphere radius from 2 to 2.5 left the rendered
checksum **unchanged**. The rendering classes did come from upstream, but the
wrapper had TRANSCRIBED upstream's scene into a local `render_once()` instead of
calling `bench_raytrace()`. Part of the workload was a private copy.

`bm_nbody_upstream.py` had the same shape: the hot kernel was upstream's, but
`bench_nbody`'s loop structure was reimplemented locally.

## The fix

Both wrappers now call **upstream's own bench function**:

- `up.bench_raytrace(loops, w, h, filename)` — upstream's timed loop and scene
- `up.bench_nbody(loops, reference, iterations)` — upstream's timed loop

The checksum is obtained without duplicating anything: upstream writes the
canvas to a PPM *after* stopping its timer, so passing a filename yields exactly
upstream's pixels with no effect on the measurement.

Optimized variants substitute a kernel by replacing the module-level symbol
(`up.advance = ...`), then calling upstream's own bench function — an explicit
one-symbol diff, with upstream's loop, state setup and energy reporting intact.

## A second bug found while fixing the first

The initial kernel substitution pre-loaded a module to capture `SYSTEM/PAIRS`,
but `base.benchmark()` then loaded a *different* fresh module. The kernel
mutated one module's bodies while upstream timed another, so the measured module
never advanced. All three kernels then "diverged" from upstream by an identical
`8.6e-01` — identical failure across unrelated kernels is the signature of a
plumbing bug, not arithmetic.

Fixed by binding the kernel to the timed module's own state via
`functools.partial(advance, bodies=up.SYSTEM, pairs=up.PAIRS)`. After the fix:

```
sqrt    energy rel_diff=2.791e-15  state rel=9.854e-16   OK
hoist   energy rel_diff=0.000e+00  state rel=0.000e+00   OK   <- bit-exact
full    energy rel_diff=2.791e-15  state rel=9.854e-16   OK
```

`hoist` being bit-exact confirms it is a pure refactor; `sqrt` shows the
expected ~1e-15 from reassociating one operation.

## Stage 0: `tools/verify_upstream.sh`

Runs automatically at the start of `run_all.sh` and both `script_*.sh`, and
hard-fails the pipeline. Five checks:

| # | Check | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PRESENT | `upstream/` exists, or is auto-extracted from the venv |
| 2 | AUTHENTIC | file hashes match the installed pyperformance package |
| 3 | UNMODIFIED | original authorship headers intact |
| 4 | EXECUTED | all 11 measured functions have `co_filename` in `upstream/` |
| 5 | **TAMPER** | editing `upstream/` changes the result; restoring recovers it |

Check 5 is the one that cannot be faked, and it was validated **negatively**: a
wrapper deliberately sabotaged to render its own scene was correctly rejected
with *"editing upstream/ did NOT change the result"*.

The manifest now records `USE_UPSTREAM`, the kind of workload measured, and the
sha256 of each kernel, so every result set carries its own provenance.

## Verified

- 15 shell scripts syntax-clean, all Python compiles
- **8/8 workloads pass `--mode verify`**
- Stage 0 passes; negative test confirms it catches a broken wrapper
- Upstream raytrace bit-identical at 24×24, **100×100 (measured)**, 37×23

## Note on this machine's `upstream/`

The local copies were reconstructed from a chat transcript, not extracted from a
package, so `PROVENANCE.txt` states `pyperformance: UNVERIFIED` and check 2
reports SKIP. Running `./setup/05_get_upstream.sh` on the VM replaces them with
the genuine files and records real hashes — after which check 2 becomes active.
